fetch_user_saved_addresses: Retrieves the user's address book, allowing the agent to offer personalized delivery location suggestions.
fetch_delivery_slots: Checks for available delivery times on a given date. Note: The Postman collection had no example response, so I've coded this based on a logical assumption of what the output will be. You may need to adjust the parsing if the actual response is different.
fetch_payment_options: Gets the list of currently enabled payment methods (e.g., COD, Online Payment).
