# REASON FOR CHANGE: This file is modified to securely connect to your PostgreSQL
# database by reading credentials from the .env file at the project root.

[alembic]
# Path to the directory containing your migration scripts.
script_location = alembic

# CRITICAL CHANGE: Tell Alembic where your .env file is located.
# It will automatically load these variables before reading the sqlalchemy.url.
prepend_sys_path = .
# This variable name is a convention used in env.py to load .env
# This is a placeholder; the real loading happens in env.py, but this makes the intent clear.
# For simplicity and directness, we will point sqlalchemy.url directly.

# CRITICAL CHANGE: The connection string for your database.
# Alembic will substitute ${...} with environment variables.
# This prevents hardcoding passwords and connection details.
# sqlalchemy.url = postgresql+psycopg2://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${POSTGRES_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}
